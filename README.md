# ZSH Polyjuice

Automatically configure [ZSH](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) based on [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) according to my habits. 

## The `Polyjuice` theme
The theme `polyjuice.zsh-theme` is based the [ys](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/ys.zsh-theme) theme.

## Usage
Install `ZSH` according the the platform you use. Clone this repository and run `polyjuice.sh`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gwbeip/zsh_polyjuice.git $HOME/.zsh_polyjuice
bash $HOME/.zsh_polyjuice/polyjuice.sh
```
