[![State-of-the-art Shitcode](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=State-of-the-art&message=Shitcode&color=7B5804)](https://github.com/trekhleb/state-of-the-art-shitcode)

Automatically configure [ZSH](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) based on [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) according to my habits. 

## The `Polyjuice` theme
The theme `polyjuice.zsh-theme` is based the [ys](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/ys.zsh-theme) theme. It will look like this.

```
# username @ HOST-NAME in ~/.zsh_polyjuice on git:main 
17:25:06 $
```

## Usage
Install `ZSH` according the the platform you use. Clone this repository and run `polyjuice.sh`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gwbeip/zsh_polyjuice.git $HOME/.zsh_polyjuice
bash $HOME/.zsh_polyjuice/polyjuice.sh
```
